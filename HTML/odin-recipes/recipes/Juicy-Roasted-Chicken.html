    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and just like the way my
      grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in the
      juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird
        is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black
        pepper, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to
        adhere to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor.
        Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.
      </li>
