    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <h4>Kebabs:</h4>
      <li>
        1 1/4 pounds beef tenderloin, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick strips, about

      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup avocado oil</li>
      <li>1/2 onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 kiwi, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons gram flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
      <li>1 small serrano chile pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup mustard oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup plain full fat yogurt</li>
      <h4>Whole Spices:</h4>
      <li>1/2 whole nutmeg seed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon whole mace</li>
      <li>5 star anise pods</li>
      <li>5 whole dried red Kashmiri chilies</li>
      <h4>Ground Spices:</h4>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pound tenderloin strips with a meat mallet until they are very thin; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat avocado oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry onion in the hot
        oil until it is a deep brown, about 5 minutes. Strain browned onion into
        a small bowl using a slotted spoon, and set aside to use later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel kiwi, cut into quarters, and set aside in a small bowl for later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat, and toast gram flour
        until lightly browned and nutty, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to a small
        bowl and set aside. Dry-roast poppy seeds in the same skillet until
        lightly brown and aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a small bowl; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, dry-roast nutmeg, mace, star anise, and Kashmiri
        chilies together until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the whole
        spices and chilies to a spice grinder, and grind them to a coarse
        powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add browned onions, kiwi, ginger paste, garlic paste, and serrano chile
        to the bowl of a food processor, and grind to a paste, about 30 seconds.
        Pour in mustard oil, white vinegar, and yogurt and pulse the food
        processor until everything is well blended, about 15 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Last of all, add roasted poppy seeds, roasted gram flour, roasted ground
        whole spices, chili powder, cumin, garam masala, black pepper, and salt
        to the food processor; process marinade for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon marinade into a resealable plastic bag and add tenderized beef
        strips. Seal bag and squeeze gently to coat beef on all sides with
        marinade. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but ideally overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove marinated beef from the refrigerator; thread beef strips on
        sturdy metal skewers, packing them in tightly. Reserve any leftover
        marinade to baste the kababs with as they cook. This prevents them from
        drying out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and lightly
        oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill kababs on the preheated grill, uncovered, for 5 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce grill temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), cover the
        grill, and cook kababs for 10 minutes. Turn kebabs, brush with marinade,
        and continue cooking until the internal temperature of the meat reaches
        170 degrees F (77 degrees C), about 10 minutes more. If kababs look a
        bit dry at any point in the cooking process, brush both sides with a
        little bit of avocado oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove skewers to a serving dish. Discard any uncooked marinade. Enjoy
        the kababs with naan, sliced red onions, tamarind chutney, and green
        chutney.
      </li>
